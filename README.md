----insurance claims management system----

You can operate this program from the Main class. You have the option to select either the customer management or claim management menu to manage the respective information.

### Customer Management
- Through the Add Customer menu, you can contract new customers with insurance.
- The Update Customer (Managing Dependent) allows for the modification of customer information. Additionally, dependents of a policyholder can be added via the Update Customer menu. The information of dependents is also managed through the Update Customer menu.

### Claim Management
- With the Add Claim menu, you can apply for a customer's claim. Applied claims can be confirmed via the Update Claim menu. Upon confirmation, the status of a claim changes from “New” to “Processing”.
- Through the Insurance Payment menu, you can make insurance payments to customers with claims in “Processing” status. The insurance payment process is successful only if the insured person’s name matches the customer's banking information (Receiver Name).
- Once the insurance payment has been successfully made, the status of the claim changes to “Done,” and a list in PDF format is saved. The saved documents can be reviewed through the List All Documents menu.
